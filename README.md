               “Improving Vancouver’s 311 Service Efficiency Using Data Analytics”

**Problem Statement:**
Vancouver’s 311 system is a vital resource for residents to report issues, seek information, and request city services. Despite its importance, there are potential inefficiencies in handling service requests, managing inquiries, and tracking contact center performance. With growing demand, it’s crucial to analyze these datasets to uncover patterns, identify service bottlenecks, and recommend improvements to optimize response times, resource allocation, and service quality.

**Project Goals:**
	1.	Understand Public Concerns: Analyze 311 service request data to identify the most frequent types of issues raised by residents across different neighborhoods.
	2.	Improve Service Response Efficiency: Use insights from 311 data to suggest strategies for improving the response times and completion rates of service requests.
	3.	Optimize Contact Center Operations: Leverage metrics from the contact center dataset to assess current performance and identify areas where operational improvements can be made (e.g., reducing wait times or improving inquiry resolution).
	4.	Predict Future Service Demand: Build predictive models to forecast future service request volumes, enabling better resource planning and staffing for Vancouver’s 311 services.
